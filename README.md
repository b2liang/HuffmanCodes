# HuffmanCodes
Bao's Huffman Codes
Generally, The goal of this project is to transform a String into binary number (encode) and reversely transform a series of 
binary numbers into a String(Decodee).

Specifically, in this program, I created a Data Tree by using many Nodes. There are two types of Nodes: ValueNodes, written as
1, are the nodes which store characters, and DecisionNodes, written as 0, are the nodes which store 2 Nodes.
